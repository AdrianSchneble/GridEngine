# GridEngine

This is where a basic description of the project will be found.  
Anyone interested in writing one, go ahead :)

# Guidelines

1) Every module has to be developed in a separate branch, and only merged once it is in a deployable state. It does have to be 100% finished, but useable.
In other words - NO DIRECT WORK ON THE MASTER BRANCH.

2) When create a new module or start working on an existing one, make sure to assign yourself to the corresponding issue.

3) When more than one person is working on a branch, make sure to commit regularly and to make arrangements, so that merging problems can be avoided.

4) Commits should describe precisely what has changed. Empty or meaningless commits are not permitted. As a rule of thumb, try to commit every file on its own, and don't make too many changes at once. Reading into how gits' stage/commit/push-system works could prove useful.
